# Opencart-Category-Name-Filter
This is a really simple filter for the admin category page. A feature that needs to be added natively by the Opencart team.

It is compatible with Opencart v2.1.0.2

Not tested with any of the previous versions!!!

It is a simple drop-in, just install via Extensions->Extensions Installer and refresh your modifications list.

It will not replace any files, it uses the built-in OCMOD system for file modifications.

You can search for a category by name, but doesn't support the autocomplete feature found on the product page. Might add it some time in the future.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

It's free.

Please don't ask for support. ;)
