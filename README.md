# Opencart-Category-Name-Filter
This is a really simple filter for the admin category page. A feature that needs to be added natively by the Opencart team.

It is compatible with Opencart v2.1.0.2

Not tested with any of the previous versions

It is a simple drop-in, just install via Extensions->Extensions Installer and refresh your modifications list.

It will not replace any files, it uses the build in OCMOD system for file modifications.
